Version: 0.0.1
Authors@R: 
    c(person(given = "Michael",
             family = "Dymock", 
             email = "michael.dymock1@hotmail.com",
             role = c("aut", "cre"),
             comment = c(ORCID = "0000-0003-4881-2860")),
      person(given = c("Stephen", "E."), 
             family = "Chick", 
             role = c("aut")))
Description: The code computes optimal stopping times for sequential experiments when samples are observed with delay.
